## SuperVideo Downloader

**A Python script for downloading videos from YouTube playlists.**

This project is a work in progress, but it's already capable of:

* **Downloading videos from YouTube playlists:**

    * Enter the URL of a YouTube playlist.
    * The script will fetch all video URLs from the playlist.
    * It will download each video to a dedicated folder named after the playlist title.

**Features to be added:**

* **Error handling:** Robust error handling for network issues, invalid URLs, and other potential problems.
* **Multi-threading:** Download videos concurrently for faster downloads.
* **Progress bar:** Visual indication of download progress.
* **User interface:** A graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

**How to use:**

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pytube
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**

   * Enter the URL of the YouTube playlist you want to download.
   * Enter a title for the playlist (this will be used for the download folder name).

**Future plans:**

* Implement advanced features like selecting specific video resolutions, choosing download formats, and scheduling downloads.
* Explore using a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt for a more visually appealing interface.
